## is everyhting in javaScript is object?

In JavaScript, almost everything is an object or behaves like one. However, it's more accurate to say that JavaScript has both primitive data types and objects.

Here's a breakdown:

Primitive data types: These are not objects. They include:

String: Represents textual data.  
Number: Represents numeric values.  
Boolean: Represents true/false values.  
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.  
Undefined: Represents the value not yet assigned.  
Symbol (ES6 and later): Represents a unique identifier.  
Objects: Objects are collections of key-value pairs where values can be primitives or other objects. Objects in JavaScript include:  

Plain objects: Created with {} or new Object().  
Arrays: Special type of objects that hold ordered collections of values.  
Functions: Special type of objects that can be invoked.  
Dates: Represents a date and time.  
Regular expressions: Used to perform pattern matching with strings.  

## JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.

 In JavaScript, objects inherit properties and behavior from other objects through a mechanism called "prototypal inheritance" rather than "class-based inheritance" as seen in many other programming languages like Java or C++.

 ```
 // JAVA Example
 // Class definition
class Animal {
    String name;

    // Constructor
    Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Method
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

// Object instantiation
Animal cat = new Animal("Cat");
cat.sound(); // Output: Animal makes a sound.


 ```


 ```
 // JavaScript Example
 // Object as prototype
let animal = {
    name: "",
    sound() {
        console.log("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
};

// Object instantiation using Object.create()
let cat = Object.create(animal);
cat.name = "Cat";
cat.sound(); // Output: Animal makes a sound.

// Modifying prototype
animal.sound = function() {
    console.log("Modified sound!");
};

cat.sound(); // Output: Modified sound!


 ```
